# Community-Fundraising-Guide
This new APAC specific Sprint project is working to create a document that guides the user through creating a custom Opportunity Record Type, Page Layout and Campaign Hierarchy to record these donations and the relationship between donors and fundraisers. Use Opportunity stages to manage the process from application, approval, letter of authority, and receipt of funds.

# Past Project Teams
We recommend creating a Wiki page for past Sprint Event volunteers (per Sprint), and that Sprints goals, accomplishments, etc. Here's a good example: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DataGenerationToolkit. If you prefer to add this information to the readme file, here's a good example of formatting you can use: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Admin-Skills-and-Nonprofit-Salesforce-Teams
